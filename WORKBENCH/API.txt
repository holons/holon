RESTFUL API
http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/httpmethods.html
In regards to using extension to define data type. I noticed that MailChimp API is doing it, but I don't think this is a good idea.
GET /zzz/cars.json/1
GET /zzz/cars.xml/1
My sound like a good idea, but I think "older" approach is better - using HTTP headers
GET /xxx/cars/1
Accept: application/json
Also HTTP headers are much better for cross data type communication (if ever someone would need it)
POST /zzz/cars
Content-Type: application/xml     <--- indicates we sent XML to server
Accept: application/json          <--- indicates we want get data back in JSON for

safe methods
Whenever possible, you should use 'safe' (unidirectional) methods such as GET and HEAD in order to limit potential vulnerability.
idempotent methods
Whenever possible, you should use 'idempotent' methods such as GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE, which can't have side effects and are therefore less error prone/easier to control.
@Computer: Doing the same PUT or the same DELETE results in the same final state. That is what "idempotent" means.
