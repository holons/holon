NPM LINKING

$ cd moduleA/
$ npm link
$ cd ../moduleB

# if moduleB package.json is pointing to a yet-unpublished
# version of moduleA, npm install will fail:
$ npm install

# this will install your local version of moduleA
$ npm link moduleA

# since moduleA is now installed, npm install will ignore it:
$ npm install

# if you want to see all installed dependencies, use
$ npm ls

# to remove a linked package from a (moduleB)s dependencies
$ npm unlink moduleA

# to remove a linked package from all modules that have it as dependency
$ cd moduleA
$ npm unlink

Dependency Watching
https://david-dm.org/

Use something like Travis CI and put the badges on your README

I will also note that Bitbucket has more favorable pricing than Github for many small private repositories, and near feature parity otherwise. Bitbucket charges per collaborator, while Github charges per private repository.

Project Module Scaffolding
https://github.com/visionmedia/ngen

Customize one of the built-in templates to your liking. You can also pull commonly-used Gruntfile snippets and other tools into a common build-tools repository that every project uses as a devDependency. For example, we have a template that includes:

a lib/.js
a lib/.test.js spec file
a README.md with a customizeable description and the basics on how to develop the module
a Gruntfile.js with watch, browserify (to build the spec files for testing), jshint, and release (for tagging)
.editorrc and .jshintrc files for maintaining code consistency.
a testem.json for configuring testem for running the tests continuously in multiple browsers.
a Makefile that serves as the catalog for all tasks that can be run and for bootstrapping development quickly. a make dev will install all the dependencies, build, and launch testem in watch mode with a single command. It also contains a make initialize command that will create the repository on Github/Bitbucket, and add all the hooks for things like Campfire and Continuous Integration.



You get all of this out of the box with a single ngen command. It is somewhat similar to Yeoman, except not opinionated. Instead, you can tailor your ngen templates to your own opinions.

COMPARE TO SLUSHjs
